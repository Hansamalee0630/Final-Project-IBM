## Project scenario
In this capstone, as the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX.  To determine the price of each launch and do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for the team. Also, determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## Summary
A new rocket company aiming to compete with SpaceX, I embarked on a capstone project to determine the price of each launch and predict the reuse of the first stage of SpaceX rockets.

## Solution
 The project showcased the use of data science and machine learning to solve complex aerospace challenges, demonstrating problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication skills. It provided insights for informed decisions about launch pricing and stage reuse, potentially leading to competitive advantages in the space industry. The high accuracy rate in predicting stage reuse led to cost savings and efficiency improvements. 


## Approach
### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning
Gathered public data on SpaceX launches.
### 2. Data Analysis
Conducted an exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and correlations within the dataset.
### 3. Feature Engineering
Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models.
### 4. Model Training
Developed and trained machine learning models.
### 5. Dashboard Creation
Built interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash.
